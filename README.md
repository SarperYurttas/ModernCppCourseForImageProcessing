# ModernCppCourseForImageProcessing
This repo contains Modern C++ Course For Computer Vision Course homeworks(at least big part of it). I'm not an internal student but I enjoyed this course and highly recommend it.
Haven't done all of them(yet) such as final project, because I didn't figure out some tasks. When I have got enough time I will try it again. 
The purpose of this repo, so that one who did same thing can compare this codes with one's own codes.
